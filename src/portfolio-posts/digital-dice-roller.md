## High Concept
A digital dice roller integrated into the top of a dice chest for use in tabletop games.

## Details
I made this digital dice roller some time in college during the pandemic. I used the ATmega328P MCU (programmed with a custom Arduino hat) as the brains, a 4x1 7-segment display, and a few push buttons.

The project was completed using perf board, which made me appreciate tight wiring and thinking out layout ahead of time. This is the first (successful) design that I made using several perf board segments that attach together, which made this project pretty fun.

The digital roller could roll d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100. There was even a selection to roll multiple dice - 2d6 for instance.
