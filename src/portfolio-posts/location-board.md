## High Concept

A simple LED indicator to indicate if I am away, present, or busy.

## Details

I made this location board in college so my roomates could see if I was in my room or not. I used an ATTiny85 (my favorite simple board) and programmed it with a custom Arduino hat.

The device included two push buttons to change the LED state and an LED driver IC.
