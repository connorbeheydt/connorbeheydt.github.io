## High Concept

Submission for the [NASA MicroG NExT](https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/micro-g-neutral-buoyancy-experiment-designteams/) project "SAVISARR", an autonomous rescue boat for astronauts stranded in aquatic environments upon landing.

## Details

This project was an ongoing effort of half a year by several talented undergraduate engineers at The Ohio State University between 2022 and 2023. The project involved tackling the SAVER challenge of NASA MicroG NExT - creating a drop-resistant signal-finding autonomous rescue drone for aquadic environments. We achieved funding through the university to implement the project.

My primary contributions were in the design and implementation of the signal-finding component of the boat, implemented with an software defined radio (SDR), a Raspberry Pi, and a custom designed 3D printed pole.

The software defined radio signal-finding component was implemented using four antennas placed in a circular configuration. The picture is from a successful initial test of the system, tracking a portable broadcast signal. For testing I implemented a neopixel "compass" with an Arduino. It was quite fun to see the light follow my collegue as she moved around the field.

Making the electronics waterproof was an interesting challenge - here is a picture of the project box we ended up using.
