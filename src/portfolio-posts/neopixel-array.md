## High Concept
Wifi-controlled array of neopixels with a wooden base and paper diffuser. 

## Details
Simple prototype for a wifi-controlled array of neopixels. The project uses both an ATmega328P and ESP32 MCU, the ATmega328P for driving the neopixels and the ESP32 for hosting a simple web server to control the array.

The array included several different color modes, scrollable text, and a clock feature.

While I was in undergrad I used it as a "Deep Work" timer.
