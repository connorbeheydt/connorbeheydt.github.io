## Event Description
A Makeathon is a hackathon for electrical engineers. The OSU Makeathon is put on by the OSU [Electronics club](https://electronicsclub.osu.edu/) (of which I later become vice president). Our team met at the beginning of the event and went on to create something that won second prize overall after review by industry judges.

## High Concept
Makeathon submission. Monitoring and managing electrical plugs in commercial houses, particilarly to reduce "vampire currents". Won second place overall.

## Details
The Plughub prototype consisted of a few sensors (temperature, humidity, CO2), an ESP32, a backend database, and a web portal to view the database.

My primary contribution was programming the sensors for the ESP2 and creating the web portal to view the Firebase database. This competition was the first time I learned that a lot of success comes down to effective communication. I was also the one who gave the pitch of the project to the judges, which gave us the edge over other prototypes.
